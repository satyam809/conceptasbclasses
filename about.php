                      At the core of an educational institute lies class room teaching. Our application based and conceptual teaching methodology, helps us to develop a study process for our students that are best for their individual learning styles and academic needs. The classes are more interactive type where students are motivated to raise and discuss their doubts/ objections to understand the concepts/ fundamentals used in problem solving. In the classrooms, we use interesting illustrations of hard-to-understand principles for easy grasping of concepts.
